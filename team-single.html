							Christian Alberto Cueva Bravo was born in Trujillo, in the department of La Libertad, when he was two years old. His family moved to Huamachuco, a small city in the Sierra Libertad where his parents are from. He is the third and youngest son of the marriage between Maqui Bravo Burgos, an administrative worker, and Luis Alberto Cueva de Ruiz, a former amateur soccer player. He has two older brothers, Marcial and Jorge His mother revealed that when she was pregnant with him she wanted her to have been a girl; however, his doctor found that he was a boy.

							On August 16, 2007, the U-20 team of the Lima club Universidad de San Martín arrived in Huamachuco to play a friendly match against the selection of that city. That afternoon, Cueva played for both teams and scored 4 goals, three with his team and another with San Martín; After that, the club decided to transfer it to its sports complex in Santa Anita, Lima. After the process of adapting to a new life in the capital, Cueva proved to be a key player at the University of San Martín.When he turned 16, he joined the ranks of San Martin. In 2012, he took a test to sign up for the César Vallejo University and finally left San Martin to become part of the Trujillo club. Once the transfer was completed, he began his new journey in the discipline of the Trujillo club starting in the 2012 season.
